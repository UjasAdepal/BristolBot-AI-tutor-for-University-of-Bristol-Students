        "answer": "CFS/ME is common.  At least 1% of teenagers miss a day a week of school because of CFS/ME. Children and young people with CFS/ME suffer because they cannot do what they want to do. They miss large amounts of school, social activities and sport. We know that mothers often have to reduce or stop work (and we assume this is likely to be true for all care givers). The National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) says that children with CFS/ME should be able to access specialist care and treatment. Specialist treatment is effective but most children in the UK do not have a local specialist service and therefore cannot access treatment."

If you subsequently find your card it can be re-activated without charge. Alternatively a replacement card can be obtained at Card Services at the Security Lodge in Royal Fort Gardens, Tyndall Avenue.  The old card will be permanently deactivated and there will be a charge for the new card.  See more information on lost cards ."

        "question": "6. How do I use my new card with contact-less readers?",
        "answer": "The U Card has a microchip embedded within it which stores your access code - instead of on a magnetic strip: this is the same technology as a bank card.  To use; simply touch the card to any reader where you see the U Card logo. Your U Card currently also has a magnetic strip which will allow you to use the existing readers, while they are replaced with smart card readers, without the need to do anything to your card.  Once the current readers have been replaced, future U Cards will not have a magnetic strip."
      },
      {
        "question": "7. How can I have additional building access added to my card?",
        "answer": "If you wish to have additional access added to your card, you must contact the appropriate U Card administrator .  Provided the change has been authorised by your head of department, the U Card Administrator is able to make any changes."
      },
      {
        "question": "8. Why do I have to reactivate my card every 24 hours?",
        "answer": "The new U Card system has been designed to work with both online (networked) and offline readers. In order to make sure offline reader information is as up-to-date as possible, and to prevent unreported lost or stolen cards being used by anyone, other than the card holder, your card needs to be regularly reactivated .  Reactivation is an automatic process which occurs every time you present your card to an online Salto reader (The type you see at main entrance(s)).  This needs to be done at least once every 24-hours otherwise your card will not be able to open any offline Salto door readers that you normally have access to.  All other functions remain unaffected.  Don’t worry if you are away or on leave for more than 24-hours, or out of the office for the weekend, you will just need to make sure that you reactivate your card at an online Salto reader on your return – your card will not lose any of its information."
      },
      {
        "question": "9. If my card is lost or stolen, could someone just walk into a building?",
        "answer": "We have built in a number of security features into the U Card system which will limit the time in which the card can be used, e.g. card reactivation for offline readers and biometric verification for high risk locations or buildings.  But you must still report your card as lost or stolen as soon as possible to Security Services on 0117 92 87848 (all calls to this number will be recorded for security purposes) 24-hours per day where we can deactivate all functions on your card immediately.  This will prevent it being used in any U Card systems.  If you subsequently find your card,  before a replacement is issued, it can be reactivated. If a replacement is needed straightaway, the process of printing a new card permanently deactivates your previous card."
      },
      {
        "question": "10. Why do most doors now have a reader to exit instead of just a push button or handle?",
        "answer": "Many walk-in thefts and burglaries that occur at the University are as a result of tailgating into a building, stealing something from a room or office and then finding the nearest external door to leave the building undetected.  Over the last few years, many fire doors have had a green emergency break-glass door release fitted to make the casual use of such doors less likely, and this has worked in reducing crime. However, many card access doors only had a reader on the outside with no need of a card to get out.  With the exception of a few areas, this arrangement has now changed so that a card is needed to open the door for exit.  You can still exit it in an emergency without a card by simply breaking the break-glass emergency door release."
      },
      {
        "question": "11 How do I request more time for the door to remain open?",
        "answer": "If a door on the access control system is held open for an extended period of time the door control will give an audible indication; short or long beeps; that it is being held open. Holding a door open will also cause a warning message to be displayed in the Security Services control room."
      },
      {
        "question": "12. How do I get out in an emergency, has my safety been compromised?",
        "answer": "No, your safety is of paramount importance to us.  In an emergency if the fire alarm is activated, doors in high-occupancy areas will automatically release.  If the fire alarm hasn’t operated or the door doesn’t open, simply break the green ‘break-glass’ button situated near them and the lock will release and you can then escape in the usual way.  However, where the ‘break-glass’ is broken this sounds an alarm nearby and it will notify the porters and the security control room that it has been activated.  A green emergency break glass is shown below:"
      },
      {
        "question": "13. Why is there no barcode on my card?",
        "answer": "The library and sports centre systems now use the same microchip technology in their readers, so the barcode on your new card is no longer necessary."
      },
      {
        "question": "14. Why do I not need a PIN anymore, has this made the card less secure?",
        "answer": "In order to make it quick and easy for all of us to use the new card system, it was decided that a PIN was not necessary as many doors are currently open during the day and, even when they are not, tailgating occurs quite easily so you don’t even need a card. In other cases, PINs have been passed between users along with their card so negating the benefit of a secondary security measure in any case. Furthermore, the speed of using your card is increased by removing the need for a PIN: a PIN makes it less convenient and more likely a door will be propped open. In addition, those with manual dexterity problems or poor sight can struggle with using a keypad making them less user-friendly."
      },
      {
        "question": "15. Why does my newUCard have less information on it?",
        "answer": "The new U Card has been designed to make it clearer and easier to read.  We have removed job  titles as these soon become out of date.  We have also taken off the department names for staff for similar reasons.  However, students retain their faculty details to aid their academic support as well as an expiry date.  We have also placed as many non-essential details on the reverse of the card as possible.  This has allowed us to increase the size of the photograph and have room to designate different types of card holder, such as Library member, contractor, building visitor, etc to make it easy to quickly identify a person, particularly in the case of out-of-hours or restricted access areas."

      {
        "question": "How can I fit my studies around work and/or family?",
        "answer": "The English Literature and Community Engagement (ELCE) course is part of Bristol’s commitment to offering more flexible learning opportunities – it is designed for people who have to balance studying with work, family, or other parts of their life. The course is taught on approximately thirty evenings per year. By concentrating the contact hours within one night per week, we hope to make the degree accessible to those with other commitments. On top of this, you would normally be expected to complete approximately 10-12 hours of work in your own time each week."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does this degree relate to the BA English that runs during the day?",
        "answer": "The BA ELCE is designed to draw on the strengths of the BA English at Bristol, which runs during the day, particular through a commitment to studying a wide variety of literature in English across many different periods. It aims to offer a similar programme within more flexible hours and in combination with a unique community engagement element. Both BAs in English are taught by the same staff and validated by the same exam board – that is, overseen by the same examiners at Bristol and externals from other universities – so the same academic standards are applied on both programmes."
      },
      {

But there is help available, both from the Government and from the University (see the information on Fees and Funding above). The new systems of loans being introduced for part-time students in 2012-13 means that any student starting an undergraduate degree for the first time will not have to pay any of their fees up front."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are the community engagement units compulsory?",
        "answer": "The community engagement units are a compulsory part of the course. However, they are also an especially flexible element of it, designed to fit with each student’s interests and other commitments. Some of our students undertake a project at work, for example, or at a community setting with which they already have some involvement. Some of our students feel nervous about undertaking this element of the course before it begins, but each student is able to develop a project that is appropriate for them."
      },
      {
        "question": "How will the community engagement work be organised?",
        "answer": "The first year of study will offer some background information and training to prepare each student for the community engagement work. During the second year, we will help you to find a suitable project in the community. You may, for example, wish to run a reading group at work or in a community setting with which you are familiar (where agreement is reached with the employer or other relevant persons); or we will be offering a range of projects organized with Bristol Libraries and a number of community groups; or you may wish to use what you are learning in other ways."

        "answer": "The units you will take in your first year will build on what you learned in A-levels, but will soon go significantly beyond that, both in content and in the style of mathematics. The following books are good references to help you prepare for this transition and are a useful study companion for the first year. Once you have registered they will both be available online free of charge via the University Library"

        "question": "How will using Germ Defence help me?",
        "answer": "During the swine ‘flu pandemic, people who used Germ Defence had fewer cold/’flu infections and they were less severe. People also saw their doctor less often. We have updated Germ Defence for COVID-19 - which is caught in the same way as other viruses - and we now want to find out how effective Germ Defence is during this pandemic."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why did my practice contact me?",
        "answer": "To find out how well Germ Defence works against COVID-19, we have asked half the GP practices in England to send a weblink to the Germ Defence website to all their patients aged 16 and over. Afterwards, we will look at national NHS data to see if patients from the practices who sent out the weblink have less COVID-19 (and other cold/’flu viruses) than patients from the practices who didn’t."

The monitors are small devices worn on a belt around the waist. They tell us how active you are – but not where you are or what you are doing. The monitor works by measuring how much you move throughout the day."

      {
        "question": "When should I wear the activity monitor?",
        "answer": "You should wear the activity monitor at all times – at home, whilst at school, and over the weekend. We ask you to put the belt on as soon as you wake up in the morning and to wear it as much possible until you go to bed at night. If you go to any clubs, such as brownies / cubs or sports clubs, you should still keep it on. The more you wear it, the better the information that you give us."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I not wear the activity monitor?",
        "answer": "There are only three occasions when you should take off the activity monitor:"
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I wear the activity monitor?",
        "answer": "You should wear the belt below your waist, so that the red box sits on your right hip. There is a small black bump (that looks like a button) on one side of the box, this black bump should always be facing upwards when the belt is in being worn."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I forget to bring back my activity monitor?",
        "answer": "If you forget to bring your belt back on the collection day, please bring it in on the next school day. It still holds valuable data, so we really need to collect it back in as soon as possible."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I lose my activity monitor?",
        "answer": "Hopefully this will not happen as you will be wearing it most of the time. However, if you think you may have lost it, please try as hard as you can to find it again and to return it to us, even if it is late. Please let us know as soon as possible if you think you may have lost your monitor as we work very hard to try and get them all back quickly."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why don’t all the schools get the Action 3:30 clubs?",
        "answer": "The division into ‘intervention’ and ‘comparison’ schools means that half the schools will receive the clubs and half will not. This is because we need to test how physically active the children in the intervention schools are compared with children who do not receive the clubs. The children in the comparison schools are just as important to our research as the children in who receive the clubs."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens to the data collected? Is it safe?",
        "answer": "We take data protection very seriously. The information we collect on all the children is stored securely. All questionnaires and computerised data are stored against an ID and not against the children’s’ names. This means that when the data is analysed it is anonymous, so the researchers will not know which child the information belongs to."
