Classes are taught at all levels, so you are welcome to begin your journey into Greek and Latin at Bristol or to expand your knowledge of the languages and literature through intermediate and advanced study. As Bristol is close to ancient sites like Bath and Caerleon, you will enhance your studies with field trips, and we run trips to cities rich in ancient heritage, like Rome or Pompeii. Studying Classics means gaining a deep appreciation and knowledge of language, analytical skills and attention to detail. These are skills highly prized by employers, so our students go on to succeed in a variety of fields, including teaching, technology, finance and broadcasting. With our broad range of subjects and types of assessment, you will have the opportunity to use your creativity, follow your ideas and research independently, and build innovative team projects. Whether you are completely new to the subject or you have been inspired by previous study, you will discover new ways of exploring the ancient Mediterranean which will expand your knowledge of Greco-Roman cultures while enriching your understanding of challenges facing us today.

You will also have the option to take other units from elsewhere in the Faculty of Arts, or beyond. In your second year, you will advance your interpretive skills in Latin and Greek while also choosing units which help you to think more deeply about the malleability of Classics - where are the borders of the ancient Mediterranean? How has classical culture been represented in the past? In your third year, you can choose from an exciting range of specialist subjects based on our department's world-class research. You will refine your skills in independent research by writing a dissertation exploring a topic of your choosing. You will also take the Applied Classics unit, which involves planning, marketing and executing a project inspired by what you love about the ancient world.

Are you keen to explore literatures and cultures in an unbordered way, so that national boundaries, disciplinary divisions and linguistic know-how are no barrier to where your curiosity and intellectual ambition might lead? Our BA Comparative Literatures and Cultures and Modern Languages degree offers an unmatched opportunity to study international cultural production in both depth and breadth, while also studying French, German, Italian, Portuguese (beginners only), Russian or Spanish. Comparative Literatures and Cultures takes you on a journey across and between cultures that will sharpen your analytical skills and equip you with a cultural agility fit for our globalized world. The programme challenges ideas of capital-L Literature or of ‘the canon’ and knocks down false boundaries between ‘high’ and ‘low’ culture by exploring the diversity of literary and cultural production both across the globe and across the centuries. Through both core and optional units, our comparatists examine the long and fascinating history of interactions between literary works and other forms (portraiture, book illustration, film), media (video, digital literature) and disciplines (visual arts, philosophy, history, social sciences). On the language side of your degree, you will follow a structured language course in your chosen language. You will also take a range of core and optional units that focus on topics such as the literature, history, cinema, religion, politics and visual art of culture(s) where your chosen language is spoken. Your third year is spent abroad, extending your language skills and cultural knowledge. To find out more, visit the Centre for Study Abroad . Bristol's multilingualism and cultural diversity make it the ideal location for this degree. The city offers countless opportunities for you to take your cultural analyses from the seminar into the ‘real world’, be this through encounters with Banksy’s street art, with murals honouring the Bristol Bus Boycott's fight for racial equality or through work on how Bristol’s institutions have responded to decolonization. The degree fosters qualities valued by employers: intercultural understanding, analytical and critical thinking, self-confidence and daring in communication, an aptitude for collaborative work, and creativity. It will instil habits of curiosity, openness, rigour, self-reflection, and evidence-based thinking, which will prepare you for a flexible career across a wide range of sectors.

The third-year units require engagement with the latest research. Students reach a high level of attainment and are well prepared for postgraduate study, both in philosophy and many other subjects. In your first year in English, you will take two units that are designed to help you make the transition to university-level study, alongside a survey unit that will introduce you to literature from a particular historical era. In your second year, you will have the opportunity to take additional survey units, as well as exploration units - which offer a deeper dive into the literature of particular historical periods - and specialist subjects, which are research-led units.

        "summary": "Course summary Bristol's Music Department is small enough to offer you a personalised degree experience. Our staff include some of the world's leading experts in their fields. Our graduates have gone on to be BBC producers, professional performers and composers, publishers, agents, lawyers, teachers, and even parliamentary private secretaries and university pro-vice-chancellors! A music degree from a highly regarded university is a fantastic entry point to a wide array of careers, and we stay in touch with a large number of former students, often via our ongoing work with music media (especially the BBC), publishers, choirs and orchestras. We support our students' journey through their music degree with professional masterclasses and composition workshops for those who love performing and composing, while most of our history teaching is done in small group seminars where we share ideas on the latest research. We are exceptionally lucky to have first-rate professional musicians teaching our students who take performance, and students have many opportunities to develop as performers during their time with us, including conducting ensembles from small choirs to whole operas. For enquiries about organ and choral scholarships, please contact the Department directly. The Department of Music webpages provide further insight into life in one of the UK's most highly regarded Music departments.

You will also have a range of optional units to choose from designed to help you develop your own core specialisation, explore different philosophical methods, engage in collaboration, and apply philosophical approaches to contemporary societal issues. In your final year, you will work on an independent study unit on almost any topic in philosophy, writing an extended essay in consultation with a supervisor with expertise in your chosen area.

Year 1 introduces the fundamentals of biomedical sciences relevant to the Dental Hygienist. Once competent in the pre-clinical setting students begin patient care under supervision (Year 1 term 2),  which includes understanding pain and anxiety control. Each patient session is entered into a Complete eAssessment Framework System (CAFS), with supervisor feedback, allowing for reflection and development. Critical Appraisal is introduced. Year 2 provides opportunities to continue patient care, building on the periodontal skills acquired in year one. Patient care is delivered across a number of clinical settings, which develops knowledge and understanding of treatment modalities in both paediatric and adult patients. Personal and Professional Development builds upon knowledge gained in year one to enhance the personal and professional attributes required of a safe practitioner. Students complete an Evidence Based Summary. The final year of the programme provides students the opportunity to consolidate underpinning knowledge to practice safely and competently using skills and clinical knowledge to diagnose, treatment plan, and treat adults and children within their scope of practice. Lectures and tutorials reduce allowing for a strong focus on clinical skills and completion of a Dissertation.

You will also develop a deep knowledge of econometrics – the application of statistical methods to data to estimate economic models and test theories – as part of this degree. Econometrics is a vital tool for economists because, unlike natural sciences where controlled experiments are used to determine the effect of one thing on another, it is impossible to hold the economy constant while tinkering with a single variable.

Experience enriching and exciting intellectual challenges from two schools with strong reputations for teaching and research. You'll build your core economics knowledge in areas like microeconomics, macroeconomics, and econometrics – the use of statistical methods to estimate economic models. Politics is organised around three themes: political theory, comparative and national politics, and international relations. You'll therefore study the politics of individual countries and governments, as well as the relationships between countries, communities and individuals. You'll also be able to tailor your degree to suit your interests and career ambitions with optional modules in both economics and politics. This enables you to explore topics ranging from global justice to behavioural economics, political thought to industrial economics, gender politics to international trade, and more. An optional dissertation will enable you to apply your knowledge and skills in a specialist area of politics if you choose – honing your research and analysis capabilities as you explore a question of particular interest to you. During the year studying abroad, you'll also explore economics and politics in a non-UK context, learning in English but at an international university in one of numerous global destinations.

Develop an understanding of the evolution of life on this planet through the study of geology and biology. Learn from experts with interests ranging from dinosaurs to plants to the origin of life, and become fully immersed in hands-on palaeontology from the start. One-third of the first year is dedicated to biology and two-thirds to earth science. After the first year, you will take core units from both disciplines. In the third year, you will carry out a research project and take a range of specialist palaeontology units. Examples of current units include: Dynamics of Macroevolution, where you will learn cutting-edge techniques for analysing the large-scale patterns in the evolution of life, including the use of microfossils to reconstruct past climates and ecosystems; Fossils and Phylogenies, where you will learn how to construct evolutionary genealogies from the comparative anatomy of fossil organisms and the genomes of their living relatives, focussing especially on the origin and diversification of animals; Vertebrate Palaeobiology and Biomechanics, where you will study the evolution of vertebrates from fish-like creatures to humans, discovering methods for investigating how their bodies work. You will also select from a range of optional units to pursue your own interests. The course involves fieldwork, including dedicated palaeontology field courses, the cost of which is included in your tuition fee. Our emphasis on quantitative research allows you to develop valuable mathematical and statistical skills. There are opportunities for volunteer work and internships in our state-of-the-art palaeobiology laboratories.

For the first two years, you will study a number of core units run by the School of Physiology, Pharmacology and Neuroscience and choose others from a wide selection, such as biochemistry, molecular genetics, infection and immunity, cellular and molecular medicine and mammalian physiology. Final-year units emphasise the molecular mechanisms of drug action and take you to the forefront of current research. In your final year, formal lectures are replaced by seminars and tutorials and a fully integrated programme of activities develops your transferable personal and professional skills.

You'll benefit from teaching that's informed by the latest developments in economics and our cutting-edge research – research which ranks in the top five for economics and econometrics amongst UK universities (REF 2021). This is complemented by units in philosophy, which will equip you with skills in textual analysis, written and verbal expression, collaborative problem-solving, logic, and critical thinking. You'll be taught by experts from one of the country's largest philosophy departments, with Bristol ranked in the UK's top ten for the subject (QS subject rankings 2024). You'll also be able to tailor your degree to suit your interests and career ambitions with optional modules. This enables you to explore topics ranging from political philosophy to environmental economics, ethics to international trade, virtue and wellbeing to behavioural economics, and more. During the year abroad you'll also explore economics and philosophy in a non-UK context, learning in English but at an international university in one of numerous global destinations. Visit Bristol Abroad to find out more. In your final year, you'll also have the opportunity to undertake an extended philosophy essay project on a topic of your choice, applying your knowledge and skills in a specialist area and supervised by a member of staff with relevant expertise.

Politics drives us to think about how society should be organised and how communities and states interact. This prompts consideration of how wellbeing is unevenly distributed in contemporary societies and the forms of social organisation necessary to enhance our lives. In the politics modules, you will study the politics of countries and governments and the relationships between countries, communities and individuals. Politics at Bristol is organised around three themes: political theory, comparative and national politics, and international relations. In your social policy studies, the first year introduces key skills and concepts within social policy so that you can familiarise yourself with theoretical, comparative and historical analyses. Your second and third years encourage you to explore your interests in greater depth through a wide range of optional units on contemporary issues. Both departments encourage strong synergy between research and teaching, resulting in a vibrant learning environment as staff respond to new research in their teaching. Skills development is woven throughout your programme and you will graduate with valuable transferable skills that ensure you are well placed to pursue your career goals.

The study of Social Policy provides an exciting opportunity to critically analyse contemporary social issues related to human wellbeing, inequality, disadvantage and crime. You will explore real-world challenges in a global context, drawing on social, political, public policy and economic theories. Both departments encourage strong synergy between research and teaching, resulting in a vibrant learning environment as staff respond in their teaching to new research.

It explores the nature, extent and causes of crime, justice, social harm and deviance in national and international contexts, as well as examining the policy responses to them within a broader conceptual and theoretical framework of social policy and related social sciences subjects. Social Policy at Bristol addresses some of the key questions of our time. What should we do about inequality? Why does poverty persist? What can be done about the climate crisis? How can citizens engage with policy? Adding Criminology extends this to questions such as: what are the serious crimes and other social harms that people experience? Why do they occur? How effective are criminal justice systems, policymakers and governments in tackling and responding to crimes and social harms?

        "summary": "Course summary If you are creative, enjoy design and aspire to improve the world around you, then civil engineering is for you. This degree will equip you to find solutions to global environmental problems and design large and unique structures that shape society - for example, buildings, bridges, water supply systems, transport networks, renewable electricity generation and other critical infrastructure assets. The course balances deep theoretical knowledge with practical application. At Bristol, you will also benefit from our world-class laboratory facilities, including one of the most advanced earthquake-shaking tables in Europe. The first two and final two years of this course are shared with MEng Civil Engineering. You will spend your third year on a placement in industry, applying the knowledge you have gained during your first two years of study. There's no direct entry into this course but you can transfer from our other civil engineering courses if you reach a high academic standard and are successful at a placement interview. Places are limited and highly competitive. The first two years provide a strong foundation in engineering, including mathematics, structures, soil and fluid mechanics, coding and surveying. Design is central to the course and this is reflected in the projects you will undertake. In the first year, you will develop a sustainable solution to an open-ended problem, such as designing and making a model bridge. The second year includes designing with steel, concrete and timber, geotechnical design and water engineering. Returning from your placement, you will carry out a major individual research project and continue to develop key practical and professional skills such as project management, entrepreneurship, economics and risk analysis. In the final year, you will be able to choose units that tailor your studies to your interests and career aspirations. You will also take part in an exciting group design project that combines all your learning as you tackle a realistic design challenge. Projects range from transportation to smart cities and from skyscrapers to sustainable housing. We work closely with industry to equip you with the skills and experiences needed to become a future leader in civil engineering. Our graduates are highly sought after by top employers, including civil engineering consultancies and construction companies, utility companies, the military, public transport providers, sustainable electricity generators, and environmental managers.

        "summary": "Course summary The International Foundation Programme (IFP) for Dentistry is a one-year programme designed for overseas students (non-UK students) wishing to enter dental (BDS) degree programmes in the UK, including at the University of Bristol. It provides an alternative pathway for students who require additional study to gain the appropriate level of qualification and the skills and aptitudes required to be considered for entry to dental degrees at universities in the UK. Successful completion of the IFP guarantees an interview for the highly regarded BDS programme at Bristol. The one-year programme will prepare you for future undergraduate studies by broadening your core knowledge in chemistry and biomedical sciences and by providing experiential learning in a healthcare environment. It provides ample opportunities for personal and professional development and for excelling in subject-specific written and spoken English. Teaching and assessment methods are designed to help you transition to university-level study and become familiar with the types of learning and assessments typically employed on dentistry undergraduate degrees in the UK. The programme is taught by highly qualified academic staff at Bristol and you will receive full access to University facilities. Progression to degree courses You are not guaranteed to progress directly to the BDS Dentistry course at Bristol. However, successful completion will guarantee you a place in the dentistry selection interview process. As your place in the interview is guaranteed, you are not required to apply through UCAS for the BDS Dentistry course at Bristol. However, you will still need to meet the standard undergraduate entry criteria. If you miss the BDS Dentistry requirements, we may offer you a place on a Life Sciences degree. You will also be free to apply for dental degrees at other universities.

The course combines in-depth study of a single discipline (your subject 'pathway') with the exploration of other subjects within the Faculty of Arts. This combination of depth and breadth enables you to develop innovative ways of thinking and provides you with an enviable range of abilities. Like the BA Liberal Arts degree, this course encourages you to explore a wide range of subjects and issues. The first two years of the MLibArts course include core interdisciplinary units that embed the study of literature, history, philosophy, art, a foreign language and data into the degree. You will be able to take optional units and also begin to develop expertise in your specialist subject pathway, which you can choose from the disciplines on offer in the Faculty of Arts. A special feature of MLibArts is the opportunity to spend your third year studying abroad at one of our prestigious partner universities. To find out more about studying abroad, visit the Centre for Study Abroad. If you are interested in the modern languages pathway, we strongly encourage you to enrol on the MLibArts course rather than the BA. Your year abroad will accelerate your language skills and provide an invaluable opportunity to develop your cultural knowledge. In the fourth year of the MLibArts, you will take master's-level units. You will research and write an interdisciplinary, master's-level dissertation, drawing on the units you studied throughout your degree.

They will be team players with a breadth of skills and qualities that enable them to work across specialisms and cultures. This course combines in-depth subject specialism at the university alongside interdisciplinary, practice-based learning. In conjunction with your music studies, you will apply your subject knowledge by translating ideas into innovative solutions, which may include plans for digital and creative enterprises, both social and commercial. The Music Department offers a broad range of units in musicology, composition and performance*, across diverse styles and genres. These are complemented by weekly concerts, regular masterclasses and performances in the department, and opportunities to get involved in the many vocal and instrumental ensembles in the department and the dynamic music scene in the city of Bristol. You will be taught by internationally recognised musicologists and composers and by a team of professional instrumental and vocal tutors. Our teaching and music-making take place in the magnificent 19th-century Victoria Rooms, a familiar Bristol landmark with a 530-seat auditorium. A number of our students have secured organ and choral scholarships with our local churches and Bristol Cathedral. Group work is a core component of teaching and learning in innovation. You will come together with students from other innovation disciplines, such as theatre, history and finance.

There's no direct entry onto this course but you can transfer from MEng Mechanical and Electrical Engineering after year two if you reach a high academic standard and are successful at interview with industry. You will study units from the mechanical and electrical disciplines along the following themes: design and integration of electro-mechanical systems; energy conversion and actuation systems; embedded systems and control; power electronics and electric drives; energy management. Years one and two offer a grounding in mathematics, thermal management, dynamics and control, computing, electrical energy technologies, and electronics. Laboratory work and case studies will draw together these interdisciplinary foundations. Your third year will be spent in industry, and in your fourth year, you will return to year three of the MEng in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering programme. In this fourth year, as well as classroom-based subjects, you will engage in a research project.  This will give you the freedom to apply the knowledge and skills that you have developed focusing on a specific topic area from actuation and sensor systems and intelligent adaptable power systems to efficient, clean propulsion technologies. Your final year (year five) will see you working as part of a larger team of students, often with an industrial partner.  Here you will solve an engineering problem related to your programme subject matter. You will also have some choice of modules offering more in-depth engineering topics. Mechanical and electrical engineering graduates will be able to innovate technologies in a range of areas. These might include: the power flow of renewable energy microgrids, from the wind to the electric generator and the power network to the user in the home; actuation systems for motion control or robotics used in healthcare and manufacturing; the power train of future electric vehicles, from the energy storage system, through to the electric motors, to the mechanical drivetrain and traction system.

The course emphasises the empirical study of the nervous system, mind and behaviour. We want our students to share a sense of fun and adventure in exploring and combining these different perspectives. MSci Psychology and Neuroscience are taught by experts who are enthusiastic about teaching students the latest developments in the field based on the research that they are conducting. In Psychology, use a variety of teaching methods (for example: lectures, seminars, tutorials, laboratory classes, group work) and assessment formats (for example: essays, research reports, in-class presentations, examinations). This variety of learning experiences caters for variations in students' learning styles and it is accredited by the British Psychological Society . It provides you with a pathway to becoming a professional psychologist. More generally, it provides you with knowledge and skills from both disciplines, which you can apply in a wide range of careers. In the first year, you will be introduced to what psychology can reveal about the mind and human behaviour, and the neuroanatomical pathways and cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying brain function. In the second year, you will continue to develop your understanding of biological, cognitive, social, developmental and individual differences in psychology, alongside the different techniques used to study the nervous system. The third year will continue your training in research design and analysis. You will also have the opportunity to focus on specific research areas, such as neurological and psychiatric disorders or interdisciplinary areas, such as behavioural and cognitive neuroscience. The knowledge and skills you acquire culminate in your final year project, in which you will complete a substantial piece of original psychological research. In addition to subject-specific knowledge and skills, you will develop transferable skills, such as teamwork, critical thinking, scientific literacy, research skills, and both oral and written communication skills (including the skills involved in presenting to an audience). These skills are highly valued by employers across a wide range of industries. They will also help prepare you for postgraduate study in psychology, neuroscience and beyond.
