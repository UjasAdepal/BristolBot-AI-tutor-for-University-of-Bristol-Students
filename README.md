# 🧠 BristolBot — AI Tutoring System for University of Bristol Students

BristolBot is an intelligent, GPT-powered AI assistant designed to help University of Bristol students navigate all aspects of university life — from academic programme details to administrative support, FAQs, accommodation, scholarships, and more.

This system uses a **hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline that combines structured academic data, university documentation, and student FAQs to generate accurate, contextual, and student-friendly answers in real time.

---

## 🔍 Features

- ✅ Hybrid retrieval: Combines FAQs with course catalogues & programme content
- 🧾 Structured scraping: Scrapes and normalizes UG/PG courses and programme catalogue pages
- 🔍 Semantic search using FAISS and SentenceTransformers
- 🧠 GPT-3.5 for grounded natural language answers
- 🧑‍🎓 Topic filters, source citations, and user feedback system
- ⚡ Streamlit frontend for live interaction
- 🗃️ Feedback logging for future tuning and evaluation

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

Here’s how it works:

```text
1. SCRAPING: Course pages, programme catalogue, FAQs, services
2. CHUNKING: Each section (summary, structure, etc.) split into ~800 token blocks
3. EMBEDDING: Chunks converted into semantic vectors using MiniLM
4. INDEXING: Stored in FAISS vectorstore (course + FAQ)
5. QUERY: User asks question → embedded → matched in both stores
6. PROMPTING: Retrieved info combined and sent to GPT-3.5 with instructions
7. RESPONSE: Clean, student-friendly answer shown with sources and thumbs up/down
```

🖼️ Architecture diagrams are included in the `/docs` folder.
